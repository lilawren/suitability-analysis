\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Most floodplain data used in the model came from the April 28th, 2016 version of the National Flood Hazard Dataset (NFHL). The model uses the 100 year floodplain data, zones A and AE to represent floodplains to avoid.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The NFHL is incomplete though, so floodplain data needed to be filled in using hand digitized polygons from the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRMs) where data were available.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In the case of lands on Native American reservation lands (Odanah and part of the Niobrara search area), DFIRMs were not available, so we generated a representative floodplain polygon using the National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2 data. For each segment of river with more than 250 square kilometers of catchment area upstream, the area of the upstream catchment in square kilometers was divided by 10 and the resulting value in meters used to buffer the segment. This buffered area represented the floodplain for these locations.}}
