\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To construct the model, we used a Random Forests Classifier in the scikit-learn package for Python. We developed code that handles data loading, withholding, randomization, and validation. Our unit of analysis was the parcel and our response variable was whether or not the parcel was chosen for the relocation site of one of the towns. All parcels for all towns were grouped together into one for this analysis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The model code, called ModelRunner, loads all of the parcel records (n=200496) with attributes from the database. It then randomizes the rows before splitting them, with 90% of records (n=180447) used for model training and 10% (n=20049) used for model validation.}
