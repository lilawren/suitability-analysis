To handle this, we developed a concept of a barrier river as way to determine parcels that were on the same side of the river as the town\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s original location or on the other side. For towns that straddled their river, this assessment does not distinguish the two. In the case of one town, the barrier line crosses a small ridgeline to connect two small drainages since the main river itself did not bisect the search area - a requirement for our analysis}}
