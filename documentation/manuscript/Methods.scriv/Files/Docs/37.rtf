\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Variables were extracted for both the town boundary and for all parcels. To get a relative measure of each value in a parcel, values subtracted the value for the original location of the town from the parcel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s value. All values were then scaled and centered so that the mean was 0 and the min and max values were -1 and 1 for consistency.}}
