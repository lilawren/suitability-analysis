\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Acros ___ runs, using this validation dataset, 20011 records were correctly predicted (99.8%) and 38 were incorrectly predicted. Of those 38 records, 35 were underpredictions, or a failure to mark a suitable relocation site as suitable, while 3 were overpredictions, or marking an unsuitable location as suitable. While we consider the 99.8% correct to be good performance for the model, one aspect is the mismatch of chosen vs not chosen sites. Only 603 parcels were chosen of the more than 200000 records, and though Random Forests handles this well, we get poor predictive power from the perspective of locating suitable sites. In the validation dataset 66 of the records were chosen sites, giving us 53% underprediction of relocation sites. The overall performance of the model indicates that the model does well in determining unsuitable locations, but the model has room for improvement in predicting suitable locations.}}
