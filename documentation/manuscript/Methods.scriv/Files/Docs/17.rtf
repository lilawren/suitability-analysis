\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To find relocation sites, we represented the landscape as a set of hexagons that stood in for parcel information. We were able to obtain real parcel data for some sites, but unable to obtain it for others, so for consistency we used hexagons as a compact, continuous unit that covers each area of interest. The hexagons had a side length of 142 meters, which produces a hexagon with an area that matches the average area of a real parcel in Monroe County, Illinois, where the town of Valmeyer in this analysis is located.}
