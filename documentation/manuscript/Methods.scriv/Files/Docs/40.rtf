\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To represent roads in the model, we digitized major roads from historical USGS topo maps. While a comprehensive roads layer exists for the United States from the US Census Bureau, there is no dataset representing historical roads at the times the towns moved and using the modern layer would skew the model. For the model, we sought to use main roads, representing potential existing connections for transportation, but exclude smaller roads that would not support through traffic.}

Any roads connecting to the symbolized roads or running through the town were also used. }}
